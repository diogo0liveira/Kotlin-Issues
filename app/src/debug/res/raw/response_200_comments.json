    "body": "Although the fix in `TypeUtils.isNullableType` looks correct to me, sadly this is a breaking change (existing code might start to throw exception or may result in a compilation error), which means we can't push it right away in the patch release. We need to get approval of the [Language Committee](https://kotlinlang.org/foundation/language-committee-guidelines.html) and probably also postpone the change itself until the next major release, which is 1.4 -- the latter part will depend on the exact decision of the committee.\r\n\r\nPlease create an [issue](https://kotl.in/issue) with the code from `multipleUpperBounds.kt` that starts to throw an exception. We'll then complete it with details relevant for the committee (this can take significant time because we need to identify the myriad of places where `TypeUtils.isNullableType` is used and specify how the change will affect that), discuss the plan internally, wait for the committee's decision and decide what exactly we'll do."
